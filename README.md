To run the application locally:

```
cd bot-api
python app.py
```

The bot has minimal user-friendly interaction (e.g. can respond to hello), as well as answer formatted messages with either StackOverflow answers or Wikipedia page summaries.
The help button in the chat window will also display additional information about this.
